0: Setup your DHCP to auto-enroll clients in DNS

	Edit your BIND configuration to make the forward and reverse zones for your lab network dynamic zones, allow dynamic updates
	Create an ACL restricting dynamic updates to only your lab network segment
	Restart BIND
	Test adding records using NSUPDATE utility

1: Create a FreeIPA Server

	Create a VM as follows
		One vNIC interface, on the internal-only network, with the lab-edge device as its default route
		Use the PXE to install the OS
	Install FreeIPA and enable it, using the ipa-server-install utility
		Configure it to be its own CA (using certmonger)
		Configure it to be its own DNS server
		Configure it to install its service records into DNS using dynamic updates
	Add groups and users

2: Deploy FreeIPA across your network

	Migrate all of the DNS records in the lab-edge server to the FreeIPA server
	Reconfigure DHCP to instead enroll DHCP clients into the FreeIPA server
	Create a manifest in the puppet master to implement the policy that all machines that get the policy will have the ipa-client package installed, and are enrolled in the FreeIPA domain
	Modify the manifest in the puppet master that implements the DNS policy to instruct all machines that get the policy to use the FreeIPA server instead of the lab-edge server for DNS resolution
	Create a device group that includes all RHEL servers, and to which the FreeIPA and DNS policies are applied
	Add the ipa-client package to your kickstart configuration in the webserver in the lab-edge box
	Validate
		Ensure that all of your users can log into all of the servers
		Ensure your users can log into any server without reauthenticating, by using Kerberos

3: Create a monitoring server

	Create a VM as follows
		One vNIC interface, on the internal-only network, with the lab-edge device as its default route
		Use the PXE to install the OS
	Install Nagios in the newly created server

4: Make sure everything is under monitoring

	Configure Nagios to monitor the following:
		IPA Server: the LDAP port, the Kerberos port, the DNS port
		ECommerce Servers: Web port, Can successfully pull a "canary" file via HTTP
		Puppet Master Server: Puppet communications port
		Lab-Edge Server: Web port, Proxy port, Can successfully download the Kickstart file via HTTP
		PXE Server: Can successfully complete a DHCP lease/release, Can successfully pull a "canary" file via TFTP
